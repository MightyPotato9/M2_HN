This repository contains my Master 2 thesis in Digital Humanities, which aims to create a data model for representing urban spaces in its various aspects. The development of said model is still under way, but you will find a few of the more complete elements that compose it so far :

- the different QGIS processes developped for qualifying specific 2D vector layers. These are accompanied by an example of results obtained on an 18th century map and a jupyter notebook which can be used to visualize the results in the "parcellaire_18e_qualifie" folder

- the jupyter notebook codes used for unsupervised clustering of land plot geometries, as well as the images of those plots they rely on in the "rasters" section

- the codes used for establishing dynamic geohistorical graphs from vector layers, which come with an example of layers in the "unions_test_graphes" and "parcellaires_test_graphes" folders
